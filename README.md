[Advent of Code][aoc] solutions written in Swift using the [Advent of Code Swift Starter Project][project] from Apple.

For every day there is a test to execute the code with test input provided for each challenge. This can be done via the `swift test` command. 

To execute the code against real data you can use the following command:
`swift run -c release AdventOfCode 1 --benchmark` command

The number corresponds with the day you want to execute. The --benchmark flag will also output the execution time for each challenge.
